BegaleBone-I2C-Java-Library
===========================
  This library written for BeagleBone Black. I combine my other I2C library (write with C++) and Java code. 
You can use I2C interface with your Java applications with this library. This library only experimental and 
I try it on Ubuntu 12.10 and work fine. But if you find some problems, report me.
